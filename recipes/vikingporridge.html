    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Barley was a staple grain in the Viking diet, and this warming porridge makes for a filling and nutritious breakfast or side dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb fresh trout fillets, skin on</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp crushed juniper berries</li>
            <li>1 tbsp crushed black pepper</li>
            <li>1 large bunch fresh dill</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, crushed juniper berries, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the dill on a large piece of plastic wrap. Place the trout fillets skin-side down on the dill, and then cover the fillets with the salt mixture.</li>
            <li>Top the trout with the remaining dill and wrap the plastic wrap tightly around the fillets.</li>
            <li>Place the wrapped trout on a tray or dish and refrigerate for 24-48 hours, turning the fillets every 12 hours to ensure even curing.</li>
            <li>After curing, remove the trout from the plastic wrap and gently scrape off the dill and curing mixture.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice the cold-cured trout and serve on rye bread or crispbread with a dollop of mustard sauce.</li>
